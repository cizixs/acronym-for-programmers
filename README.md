Acronyms every programmer should know.

## TL;DR

**Too long; didn't read**

Usually appears at the beginning of a long article, indicating people who are too lazy/buzy that this post takes a long time to read, close the tab if you are not really interested.

## IMHO

**In my humble opinion**

Used to clarify that the statement being made should not be quoted as a fact, but only as an opinion.

## LGTM

**Looks good to me**

Very popular comment message on Github, used as a quick response after reviewing someone's essay, code, or design document.

There is a [website for this](http://www.lgtm.in/).

## RTFM

**Read the fucking manual**

> The RTFM comment is usually expressed when the speaker is irritated by another person's question or lack of knowledge. It refers to either that person's inability to read a technical manual, or to their perceived laziness in not doing so first, before asking the question.

But another perspective for the acronym goes like this:

## RTFC

**Read the funcking code**

This is similar to `RTFM`. There is another version RTFSC(Read the fucking source code), used when speaker is pissed by a question can be answered by reading a few lines of code.

## XKCD

This is not an acronym actually, I just love xkcd.com so much that I have to put it here.
